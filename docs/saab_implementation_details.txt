SAAB Tech2 Protocol Implementation Details
=======================================

1. Serial Port Configuration
---------------------------
- Direct port access using os.open() on Windows
- Port path: \\\\.\\COM5
- Flags: O_RDWR | O_BINARY
- No baud rate or other serial settings needed with direct access

2. Protocol Commands
------------------
a) Download Mode Command:
[239, 86, 128, 59] // Hex: EF 56 80 3B
- Used to enter download mode
- Must be sent twice (once to switch, once to verify)
- Requires 1-second delay after port open
- Expects 4-byte response on verification

b) Restart Command:
[139, 86, 0, 31] // Hex: 8B 56 00 1F
- Used to restart the Tech2
- Expects 4-byte response
- Requires 15-second delay after restart

3. Data Reading Sequence
----------------------
Five sequential read commands with different offsets:

a) Read Command Structure:
[129, 90, 15, 46, offset_high, offset_low, length_high, length_low]
// Base command: 81 5A 0F 2E

b) Specific Read Commands:
1. [129, 90, 15, 46, 0, 0, 166, 66] // Read 169 bytes at offset 0
2. [129, 90, 15, 46, 0, 166, 166, 156] // Read 169 bytes at offset 166
3. [129, 90, 15, 46, 1, 76, 166, 245] // Read 169 bytes at offset 332
4. [129, 90, 15, 46, 1, 242, 166, 79] // Read 169 bytes at offset 498
5. [129, 90, 15, 46, 2, 152, 50, 28] // Read 53 bytes at offset 664

4. Timing Parameters
------------------
- Port stabilization delay: 1000ms
- Connection verification timeout: 8000ms
- Read operation timeout: 15000ms
- Restart wait time: 15000ms

5. Data Structure
---------------
Total data size: 714 bytes
Breakdown:
- 4 chunks of 166 bytes each (664 bytes)
- 1 chunk of 50 bytes
- Each response includes 2-byte header (not included in final data)

6. Python Implementation
----------------------
Key improvements:
- Direct port access using os.open() instead of serial library
- Simplified port configuration
- More reliable communication
- Better error handling
- Proper port cleanup

7. Error Handling
---------------
- Connection timeout: 8 seconds for verification
- Read timeout: 15 seconds for each data chunk
- Restart timeout: 15 seconds
- Buffer overflow protection
- Response validation for each command
- Port access error handling

8. Notes
-------
- Each data response includes a 2-byte header that should be stripped
- The protocol appears to be stateful, requiring specific command sequences
- The device must be in the correct mode before data can be read
- Total data size is fixed at 714 bytes
- The protocol includes built-in error checking and timeouts
- Direct port access provides more reliable communication than serial library
- Port may need to be reinitialized (unplug/replug) if access is denied
