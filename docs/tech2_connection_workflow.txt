Tech2 Serial Connection Workflow
==============================

1. Initial Connection Setup
--------------------------
- Open COM port in binary read/write mode
- No flow control settings required
- Default baud rate: 38400
- Wait 1 second after opening for port stabilization

2. Download Mode Initialization
-----------------------------
a) First Command:
   - Send: EF 56 80 3B
   - Wait 2 seconds after sending
   - No response expected

b) Verification Command:
   - Send same command again: EF 56 80 3B
   - Wait for 4-byte response
   - Expected response: EF 56 01 BA
   - Timeout: 8 seconds

3. Restart Sequence
------------------
a) Send Restart Command:
   - Command: 8B 56 00 1F
   - Close connection immediately after sending
   - No response wait needed
   - Tech2 will process restart independently

4. Timing Parameters
-------------------
- Port stabilization: 1 second
- Download mode delay: 2 seconds
- Verification timeout: 8 seconds
- No wait needed after restart command

5. Success Indicators
--------------------
- Port opens successfully
- Download mode command sent successfully
- Verification response received (EF 56 01 BA)
- Restart command sent successfully
- Connection closes cleanly

6. Error Handling
----------------
- Port open failures
- Command send failures
- Response timeouts
- Invalid responses
- Connection close failures

7. Key Points
------------
- Direct binary port access
- No flow control needed
- Immediate connection close after restart
- Tech2 processes restart independently
- No permission issues with direct port access

8. Example Command Sequence
--------------------------
1. Open COM5
2. Wait 1s
3. Send: EF 56 80 3B
4. Wait 2s
5. Send: EF 56 80 3B
6. Wait for: EF 56 01 BA
7. Send: 8B 56 00 1F
8. Close connection
